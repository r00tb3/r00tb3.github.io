    Hey, I am Amit Vitekar a.k.a <a href="https://twitter.com/r00tb3">'r00tb3'</a>. I'm a security research enthusiast.
  </p>
  <p>
    My area of interests are GSM, UMTS, LTE & 5G cellular networks security alongside, I like to mess around with vertical networks like V2X, NB-IoT, Wi-Fi etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    Development, Reverse Engineering and Exploitation of Basebands, Embedded Systems, Firmware's, RF protocols of IoT devices, Automotive Vehicles and other Cyber-Physical systems is where I mostly lurk around.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Journey in the security domain started when I was 16 where network and wireless security caught my attention since then I've been exploring and exploiting. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Since past few years I've learned few things in security and to share it I've curated a list of all resources which can be found at  <a href="https://r00tb3.github.io/security/2018/01/20/Security-Resources-Part-1.html">Security Resources Part-1</a>  &  <a href="https://r00tb3.github.io/security/2018/02/05/Security-Resources-Part-2.html">Security Resources Part-2</a>  for newbie's and professionals so they don't need to lurk around the internet looking for resources.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm a big fan of korean thrillers and mysteries.
