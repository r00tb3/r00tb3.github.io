    Hey, I am Amit Vitekar a.k.a 'r00tb3'. I'm currently an undergrad at <a href="http://www.unipune.ac.in/"> University of Pune (SPPU)</a> pursuing Bachelor of Engineering (B.E) in Electronics & Telecommunication.
  </p>
  <p>
    My area of interests are Low-level Exploitation, RE, Telecom & Network Security etc. Journey in the security domain started when I was 16 where network and wireless security was something that caught my attention since then I've been learning InfoSec. I am a member of <a href="http://www.iete.org/">IETE (Institute of Electronics & Telecommunication Engineers)</a>, where we conduct various events, talks and research related to ECE also  a member and speaker at <a href="https://null.co.in/profile/7091-amit-vitekar">NULL</a> where security reseachers and enthusiasts come together for meetup to discuss and share new topics of research in security .
  </p> 
  <p>
    Since past few years I've learned few things in security and to share it I've curated a list of all resources which can be found at <a href="https://github.com/r00tb3/SECURITY-RESOURCES#security---resources--beginner-to-advanced">SECURITY - RESOURCES : BEGINNER TO ADVANCED
    </a> for newbie's and professionals so they don't need to lurk around the internet looking for resources.

    I'm a foodie and big fan of korean movies.
