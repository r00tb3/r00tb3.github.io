    Hey, I am Amit Vitekar a.k.a <a href="https://twitter.com/r00tb3">'r00tb3'</a>. I'm a security research enthusiast.
  </p>
  <p>
    My area of interests are GSM, UMTS, LTE & 5G cellular networks security alongside, I like to mess around with vertical networks like V2X, NB-IoT, Wi-Fi etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    Development, Reverse Engineering and Exploitation of Basebands, Embedded Systems, Firmware's, RF protocols of IoT devices, Automotive Vehicles and other Cyber-Physical systems is where I mostly lurk around.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Journey in the security domain started when I was 16 where network and wireless security caught my attention since then I've been exploring and exploiting. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Since past few years I've learned few things in security and to share it I've curated a list of all resources which can be found at  <a href="https://r00tb3.github.io/security/2018/01/20/Security-Resources-Part-1.html">Security Resources Part-1</a>  &  <a href="https://r00tb3.github.io/security/2018/02/05/Security-Resources-Part-2.html">Security Resources Part-2</a>  for newbie's and professionals so they don't need to lurk around the internet looking for resources.

    My other areas of studies and research also include vedic sciences. Out of the six limbs of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedanga">vedangas</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_astrology">Jyotiá¹£a</a> also known as Jyotish Shashtra(Vedic Astrology) has always amused and excited me to study and predict the timing of events from a vedic sciences prespective. 
    I am actively studying <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brihat_Parashara_Hora_Shastra"> Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra </a>. Open to discussions and research about the same.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I'm a big fan of korean thrillers and mysteries.
