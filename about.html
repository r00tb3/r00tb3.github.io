    Journey in the security domain started when I was 16 where network and wireless security caught my attention since then I've been exploring and exploiting.

    Since past few years I've learned few things in security and to share it I've curated a list of all resources which can be found at  <a href="https://r00tb3.github.io/security/2018/01/20/Security-Resources-Part-1.html">Security Resources Part-1</a>  &  <a href="https://r00tb3.github.io/security/2018/02/05/Security-Resources-Part-2.html">Security Resources Part-2</a>  for newbie's and professionals so they don't need to lurk around the internet looking for resources.
